        <h1>My Intro Questions</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Name: Analise Black, Major: Psychology and Minors: Computer science and French, Year: Senior</li>
            <li>I have some experience with HTML/CSS/JS, as I took web development last semester and those were the languages focused on.</li>
            <li>I hope to strengthen my skills with HTML/CSS/JS and learn how they interact through a design lens.</li>
            <li>I imagine designing for screen would require more thought about functionality and interactivity of the elements than designing for paper, as the users will likely be interacting with the screen (more so than paper).</li>
            <li>I think the <a href="https://www.casetify.com/" target="_blank"> casetify website</a> exemplifies effective design. It has a simple design with the key sections a user may want to visit at the top of the screen and more interactive/attention-grabbing images the further one scrolls down. It highlights featured/trending designs, and is easy to navigate.</li>
            <li>I think the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/" target="_blank">BBC website</a> exemplifies effective communication. There are a lot of different stories and headlines at one time, and BBC communicates these different topics in a non-overwhelming manner. The stories that have more relevance, or are ongoing, are enlarged and placed in the center of the screen with "live" stories being indicated by a red icon. I think this effectively communicates which stories are live and may be considered more "groundbreaking." </li>
            <li>I think the <a href="https://chibird.com/" target="_blank">chibird website</a> works well for its purpose. Its design fits the aesthetic of chibird and is easy to navigate with links to other chibird related sites (i.e. the store, FAQs, etc.). It also effectively communicates what/who chibird is while maintaining a central emphasis on her art (displayed in the middle of the screen).</li>
