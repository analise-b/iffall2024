                    Spider-Verse
                    (2018)
                    the following month, Sony Pictures Animation had begun developing a sequel due to the "incredible
                    buzz"
                    surrounding the project. The sequel was to continue the story of Miles Morales / Spider-Man, working
                    from "seeds [that were] planted" throughout the first film. Joaquim Dos Santos and David Callaham
                    were
                    set
                    to direct and write, respectively, with Amy Pascal returning from the first film as producer. </p>

                <p class="pProductionT">The other producers of the first film—Phil Lord,
                    Christopher
                    Miller, Avi Arad, and
                    Christina
                    Steinberg—were all also expected to return in some capacities. The next month, Pascal revealed
                    that
                    the
                    film
                    would focus on Miles and Gwen Stacy / Spider-Woman, exploring a romance between the characters
                    that
                    was
                    cut
                    from
                    the first film, and that the sequel would be a "launching pad" for a previously announced
                    female-focused
                    spin-off film featuring Gwen. Sony officially confirmed the sequel in November 2019, with Lord
                    and
                    Miller
                    returning as producers and a release date of April 8, 2022, announced.</p>

                <p class="pProductionT">In December, Lord and Miller revealed that the film was being split into two
                    parts: Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (Part One) and (Part Two), because they had written the
                    story they wanted to tell for the sequel and realized it was too much for one film. The sequels were
                    renamed in April 2022, becoming
                    Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse and Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse. Their release dates
                    were shifted then, with Across the Spider-Verse pushed back to June 2, 2023. They added that the
                    film had 240 characters and would take place across six universes.</p>

    <p class="pProduction">Daniel Pemberton confirmed in December 2020 that he would return to compose the sequel's
        score. In December 2022, Lord and Miller confirmed that Metro Boomin would create music for its soundtrack.
        Several artists were featured on it, including 21 Savage, Swae Lee, Lil Wayne, Future, Nas, ASAP Rocky, Lil Uzi
        Vert, Wizkid, Coi Leray, Offset, Becky G, Shenseea, A Boogie wit da Hoodie, JID, Don Toliver, James Blake, and 2

    <p class="pProduction">For the Japanese release, an original song, "Realize" performed by Lisa, was featured. The
        film was supported by another single, "Mona Lisa" by Dominic Fike, released on June 2, 2023—the day of the
        film's premiere. Although originally set to be released as a track on the deluxe edition of the soundtrack
        album, a few days after its release, the track was removed. On June 23, 2023, it was announced that the track
        was added into some versions of Fike's second studio album Sunburn, which was released on July 7, 2023.</p>
