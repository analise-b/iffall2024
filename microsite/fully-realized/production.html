    <p class="pProduction">By the end of November 2018, ahead of the release of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018)
        the following month, Sony Pictures Animation had begun developing a sequel due to the "incredible buzz"
        surrounding the project. The sequel was to continue the story of Miles Morales / Spider-Man, working
        from "seeds [that were] planted" throughout the first film. Joaquim Dos Santos and David Callaham were set
        to direct and write, respectively, with Amy Pascal returning from the first film as producer. </p>
    <p class="pProduction">The other producers of the first film—Phil Lord, Christopher Miller, Avi Arad, and Christina
        Steinberg—were all also expected to return in some capacities. The next month, Pascal revealed that the film
        would focus on Miles and Gwen Stacy / Spider-Woman, exploring a romance between the characters that was cut from
        the first film, and that the sequel would be a "launching pad" for a previously announced female-focused
        spin-off film featuring Gwen.Sony officially confirmed the sequel in November 2019, with Lord and Miller
        returning as producers and a release date of April 8, 2022, announced. In April 2020, Sony shifted the
        film's release to October 7, 2022.</p>
    <p class="pProduction">In February 2021, Miller said that he and Lord were working on the film's screenplay with
        Callaham, and that Peter Ramsey would be an executive producer on the sequel after co-directing the first
        film.[60] That April, Kemp Powers and Justin K. Thompson were announced as co-directors alongside Dos Santos,
        and that all three had worked on the project since it began. (Thompson was production designer on the first
        film.) Arad and Steinberg were confirmed to return as producers with Lord, Miller and Pascal, with Alonzo
        Ruvalcaba co-producing and Aditya Sood, Into the Spider-Verse directors Bob Persichetti and Rodney Rothman, and
        Rebecca Karch and Brian Michael Bendis joining Ramsey as executive producers.</p>
    <p class="pProduction">In December, Lord and Miller revealed that the film was being split into two parts:
        Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (Part One) and (Part Two), because they had written the story they wanted to
        tell for the sequel and realized it was too much for one film. Work on both parts was taking place
        simultaneously. The sequels were renamed in April 2022, becoming Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse and
        Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse.</p>
    <p class="pProduction">Their release dates were shifted then, with Across the Spider-Verse pushed back to June 2,
        2023.[63][64][65] Lord and Miller said that they had told Sony the sequel would be the same size as Into the
        Spider-Verse, but it ended up having the largest crew of any animated film ever, with around 1,000 people
        working on it.</p>
    <p class="pProduction">They added that the film had 240 characters and would take place across six universes.[63]
        Characters that were considered to appear in Across the Spider-Verse but were ultimately rejected include
        versions of Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, Kraven the Hunter, Mysterio, Electro, Shocker, Rhino, Hobgoblin,
        Chameleon, Puma, Leap-Frog, Alistair Smythe, Grizzly, Boomerang, Screwball, Big Wheel, Beetle, and Diamondhead.

    <h1 id="productionTitle2" class="pageTitle">Music</h1>
    <p class="pProduction">Daniel Pemberton confirmed in December 2020 that he would return to compose the sequel's
        score. In December 2022, Lord and Miller confirmed that Metro Boomin would create music for its soundtrack.
        Several artists were featured on it, including 21 Savage, Swae Lee, Lil Wayne, Future, Nas, ASAP Rocky, Lil Uzi
        Vert, Wizkid, Coi Leray, Offset, Becky G, Shenseea, A Boogie wit da Hoodie, JID, Don Toliver, James Blake, and 2
        Chainz.</p>
    <p class="pProduction">For the Japanese release, an original song, "Realize" performed by Lisa, was featured. The
        film was supported by another single, "Mona Lisa" by Dominic Fike, released on June 2, 2023—the day of the
        film's premiere. Although originally set to be released as a track on the deluxe edition of the soundtrack
        album, a few days after its release, the track was removed. On June 23, 2023, it was announced that the track
        was added into some versions of Fike's second studio album Sunburn, which was released on July 7, 2023.</p>
    <p class="pProduction">Though external to the film's score and soundtrack, Daniel Kaluuya also incorporated musical
        elements into his vocal performance as Spider-Punk / Hobie Brown. Kaluuya elaborated that he searched for
        the word "Spider-Punk" on Spotify, hoping to find fan-made playlists. </p>
    <p class="pProduction">He stated that after finding some he "would just listen to them, be like vibing out," helping
        him with the process of gauging the character's energy.[105] Kaluuya further noted that "he wanted the
        character's voice to feel like a song," and that a take in which he portrayed the character as "rapping, but in
        a punk style" would be the one used in the film.</p>
