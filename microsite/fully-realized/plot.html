        <p class="pPlot">On Earth-65, Spider-Woman Gwen Stacy has become increasingly isolated from her friends and
            estranged from
            her
            father George. George is hunting Spider-Woman for killing Peter Parker, unaware that it was an accident
            after Peter turned into the Lizard. George corners Gwen and she reveals her identity to him, and he attempts
            to arrest
            her
            before she leaves with Jess and Miguel.</p>

        <p class="pPlot">In Brooklyn on Earth-1610, 16 months after Kingpin's defeat and the destruction of the Alchemax
            collider, Miles Morales encounters the Spot, an Alchemax scientist-turned-supervillain whose body was
            infused with portals during the explosion. Gwen travels to
            Miles' dimension and they reconnect, sharing their struggles and hinting at feelings of attraction towards
            each other.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="plotFlex">
        <p class="pPlot">Gwen secretly tracks the Spot, and opens a portal to the next alternate universe he has gone
            to, Earth-50101. Miles discretely follows Gwen into the portal, and the two team up with Earth-50101's local
            Spider-Man Pavitr Prabhakar, and later Hobie Brown, against the Spot. The Spot escapes and Miles saves Singh
            from the
            collider's destruction, but the world begins to collapse before other Spider-People arrive to contain the
            damage.</p>

        <div id="nuevaYorkImage" class="plotBodyImage"></div>
        <p class="pPlot">Miles, Gwen, and Hobie are taken to Nueva York in Earth-928, where a multiversal society of
            Spider-People, known as the Spider-Society, work together to combat threats. Miles meets Miguel, the leader
            of the Society, who explains to Miles that each of the Spider-People's stories contain "canon events" which
            cannot be disrupted otherwise they risk the collapse of that
            universe, which in turn will collapse the whole multiverse as a consequence.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="plotFlex">
        <p class="pPlot">Miles realizes that the Spot
            killing Jeff is a canon event and is imprisoned by Miguel to prevent Jeff from being saved. Miles frees
            himself and flees with the Society in pursuit. Miguel corners Miles and tells him that
            he was never supposed to become Spider-Man and that Earth-42 has no Spider-Man because of him. Miles
            overpowers Miguel and flees back to his own universe.</p>

        <p class="pPlot">
            Miles and Gwen realize
            that the former is in Earth-42 and not his own earth. In Earth-42, Miles' late uncle Aaron Davis is alive,
            and New York is crime-ridden due to the lack of Spider-Man. Aaron restrains Miles, and
            is joined by Miles' Earth-42 counterpart, the Prowler. As the Spot begins his attack on Earth-1610's New
            York, Miles prepares to escape his restraints. Gwen teams up with Peter B., Mayday, Pavitr, Hobie, and
            others.
