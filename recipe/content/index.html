            <ul>
                <li>For the profiteroles:
                    <ul>
                        <li>50g butter</li>
                        <li>75g plain flour, sifted</li>
                        <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
                        <li>150ml water</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>For the filling:
                    <ul>
                        <li>200ml double cream</li>
                        <li>150g strawberries, hulled and diced</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>For the chocolate sauce:
                    <ul>
                        <li>100g chocolate</li>
                        <li>1/4 cup of cream</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <div id="steps">
            <h2>Steps:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to
                    220C/fan
                    200C/gas mark 7.</li>
                <li>To make the profiteroles; put the butter in a pan with 150ml water, bring to the boil to melt the
                    butter.</li>
                <li>Remove from the heat and immediately add all the flour and beat with a wooden spoon to get a
                    smooth dough that comes easily away from the pan. Cool for five minutes.</li>
                <li>Vigorously beat in the eggs a little at a time until you have a thick and glossy mixture. Itâ€™s
                    important
                    to beat it hard to incorporate as much air as possible.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle a little water on two baking trays
                    and
                    use a teaspoon or piping bag to make blobs of the mixture on the trays. Bake for around 15 minutes
                    until
                    puffed up and golden.</li>
                <li>Remove from the oven, make a small slit in the base of each pastry, and return to the
                    oven
                    for three more minutes. This helps release the steam and create a crisper shell.</li>
                <li>Leave to cool on a
                    wire
                    rack.</li>
                <li>Rinse your strawberries and dice them into fine chunks.</li>
                <li>Beat the cream with a whisk in a bowl until it is thick and there are peaks when you lift the whisk.
                    Stir in the chopped strawberries. </li>
                <li>Cut a hole in the side of
                    the profiteroles and fill each with the strawberry cream mix.</li>
                <li>Arrange the profiteroles on a platter or in a bowl and place them in the fridge while you make the
                    chocolate sauce.</li>
                <li>Add the cream and chocolate to a bowl. Place this bowl in the microwave or in a heat-proof bowl over
                    a pan of simmering water, and melt the chocolate. Stir regularly.</li>
                <li>Once the chocolate has melted and mixed with the cream, remove
                    the profiteroles from the fridge and drizzle the
                    chocolate sauce over them.</li>
                <li>Allow the drizzled chocolate sauce to cool, and then serve them!</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>This is a good site reference, as it is aesthetic and also has many features that seem to be
                        user-focused. At the top of the page,
                        it gives the user the option to jump straight to the recipe (so they don't have to scroll
                        through the description), the comment
                        section (to see other users' reviews), and others. It includes a lot of images of the individual
                        ingredients, the baking steps,
                        the end product, as well as a video. Additionally, the recipe is interactive and allows the user
                        to check of ingredient items.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>This website has an eye catching video of the recipe at the top of the page, as well as the
                        immediate information
                        a person would want to know regarding the item (i.e. cooking time, serving size, etc). It also
                        has a lot of images of the
                        cooking steps, as well as a user review section (can upload images), and the ability to easily
                        navigate the page by jumping to different sections.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>This site provides detailed directions and description of the product. I think it could be more
                        effective if it included the basic recipe information (i.e. cooking time, servings, etc.)
                        at the very top of the page and not after the personal description, as well as more images.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>I like how the home page is a big background image, with navigation tabs to continue the
                        experience. The imagery is very distinct, and the main focus is on the scenery. Something
                        similar could be done with an image of profiteroles/baking step.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><a href="https://art-timeline.com/" target="_blank">Art Timeline:</a>
                <ul>
                    <li>The horizontal scroll feature of this website with images for different art periods is
                        interesting. It makes it clear the order/sequence of the periods, and I could see something
                        similar being implemented vertically for the baking steps (i.e. each step has a cover image that
                        when clicked reveals the directions, and these images all flow vertially).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><a href="https://motion.zajno.com/" target="_blank">Motion.ed:</a>
                <ul>
                    <li>The bold lettering and contrast colours between the words and the background images makes the
                        page easy to read and the topics standout. The lettering is very distinct and captures your
                        attention. This may help me when choosing colours for my design, as it may be good to have
                        something similarily eye-catching and distinct. The ball that moves/bounces as the user moves to
                        a new topic is also interesting, as it helps focus your attention.</li>
